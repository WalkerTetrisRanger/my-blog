### Datacamp, pandas!? maybe some OSSU...lets see 

**But first**  
...I need to learn markdown language syntax...I read somewhere that presentation matters so figuring out how to do headings and bold or italics using markdown language to try and make these posts look better. 

# This should be a large heading 

###### This should be a small heading

**bold?**, *italics?*

Cheers, 
Eddie (WTR)
