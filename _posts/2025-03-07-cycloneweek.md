# CYCLONE WEEK!

cyclone alfred is on his way here, for the first time in decades...we bought a house that survived the 1974 cyclone...it was only 4 years old at the time, hopefully damage is limited to the old shed out back...

all this cyclone prep has been very distracting...

### week 1 begins

At home today and I have just participated in our first online tutorial for DIG5BDM...big data management in healthcare...  

Assessment 1 is about the Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset (which captures data on all hospital admissions in Victoria...this is utilised primarily as a funding instrument, and then for health service planning and research..I think) we have to record a video of our presentation and upload in a little over a week...

My progress has been ok, have read through the first two sections and taken notes as I went. Formatted a presentation using libre impress on linux, seems pretty good.  

my plan is to record the presentation on teams and use my tablet to share the powerpoint screen, that way I can annotate on it as I go...

I am up to the last step on the assessment which is identifying potential research questions using the VAED, I am researching novel uses of digital health datasets in contemporary research and hoping that is going in the right direction, just waiting on clarifying with the teaching team before I go ahead too far...

Now working on week 2 content.

Cheers, 

Eddie (WTR)
