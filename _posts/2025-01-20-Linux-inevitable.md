## Diving into Linux

### learning linux via overthewire.org wargames

It was probably inevitable but I have taken the dive into using linux. I got an old XPS 13 and am replacing the battery.

So far I have tried Ubuntu LTS and am now on linux mint...everything works without installing any extra drivers. 

Just did a nightshift and work tomorrow morning so no study, just playing for now. Messing about with installing Kali linux on a virtual machine. 

over the wire has been great, but I am very slow! the discord helps.
