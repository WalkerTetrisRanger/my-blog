Welcome to my brand new blogging space hosted through github. 

I just finished drafting the about page and made it live using a git. bash terminal (did I say that right?)

Without further ado... <br>

I plan to use this blog as my learning diary to summarise progress and keep me accountable.

Currently studying: CompSci from OSSU on github <br>
Learning: Python through OSSU and Datacamp
Planning: Master of Digital Health

I just realised I can use this page to host my CV as well as link to any projects I've done to form a portfolio. 

Cheers, 
Eddie "WTR"
