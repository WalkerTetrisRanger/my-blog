# Human Factors in Incident Analysis

A step away from compsci/digital health in this post...  
I have found that doing these posts is actually a good way of forcing myself to write concise notes...and I think it is helping me learn...  


So if anybody is reading this...I am doing some incident analysis CPD for nursing at the moment, enjoy! 

## lect outline  
1. What is Human Factors?
2. Healthcare challenge
3. HF approach to root cause analysis
4. Case studies: using HF to understand risk, inform procurement and respond to near-misses
5. Barriers to HF adoption in healthcare
6. HF methods and resources


### What is Human Factors?  
"concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system. A profession that applies theory, principles, data, and methods to design in order to optimise human well-being and overall system performance".


### Core skillsets for human factors professionals
- cognitive ergonomics
	+ fit between human cognition and machine/task/environment 
- organisation ergonomics
	+ design and optimisation of the overall sociotechnical system....e.g. org structures, policies, processes
- Physical ergonomics
	+ fit between human body responses to physical and physiological work demands

### Challenge in healthcare  
`healthcare = str(complex adaptive system, numerous stakeholders, operates at distinctive yet interconnected levels within the system)`
- health systems don't react predictably to the same inputs 
- much effort is spent trying to 'stomp out' error after harm


Clinical incidents *may* be caused by: 
- interactions between multiple actors; and not just clinical staff
- multiple interaction contributing factors from across all levels of the system
- lack of vertical integration/feedback between hierarchical levels  
(e.g. frontline does not inform higher level decisions, higher level decisions not reflected in practices at frontline). 
- financial, psychological and other pressures
- gradual erosion of risk controls over time


### RCA
undertaken to review care and find out what went wrong and why...

Inefective analyses:  
check out: RCA**2 - improving root cause analyses and actions to prevent harm...www.npsf.org  
*Includes* five rules of causation...


### Case Example...NICU heparinised syringes...
"the product is often part of a system composed of other products...end user complexity depends on all products in users environment..."  


### Example methods and resources...
1. cognitive walkthrough
2. observational field work
3. Simulation studies

good lecture all in all, 

very relevant case examples for analysing clinical incidents in the workplace....
