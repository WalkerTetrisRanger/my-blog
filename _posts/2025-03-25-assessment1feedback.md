# I have finished the first subject in my masters

First subject is completed...DIG5BDM. 

It was a good learning experience and La Trobe online was structured very well....

However, 

WIth baby 2 due to popout any day now I've decided to take a leave of absence and focus on family for a little while. 

I plan to continue my OSSU computer science journey and do more linux mastery so I can get some cybersecurty skills

Cheers!
