# blog maintenance!
studying at everton park library today, 
had to reclone my blog from git after doing a fresh ubuntu install (firmware update broke my XPS...cheers Dell). So definitely a bit of time wasting happening with SSH keys. I've done this a few times now, and it is getting easier to understand how ssh keys etc. work...mostly installing linux and using overthewire.org wargames has helped with feeling confident and familiar...

##Everon Park Library
really good, has a quiet room over to the side, big windows with a desk that has some nice greenery to keep you sane. quiet room looks good but the desk doesn't look out the window...maybe bring noise cancelling headphones if it is busy...here is a photo

***onto the study***

`study_session = week1-prework.py`

here we go. 

*sidebar:* Studying with Gandalf is great for some background music to study to...one of the guys I worked with mentioned Gandalf studied for 17years to discover the true origins of the ring in Bilbo's posession! 

## week 1
"typing out my notes so I am doing something with the information instead of just passively reading it...

by the end of this week we have 2 topics to understand...these contribute to one of the main learning objectives in the course. An intro to big data and how its applied in healthcare, and the software/architecture used to store and access big data...  
  
  
not going to include all of my notes...as I don't want to get pinged by uni...but I can at least summarise my thoughts etc using the blog...
