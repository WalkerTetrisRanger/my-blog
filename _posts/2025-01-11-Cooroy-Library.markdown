# Python in Cooroy Library

### apparently there is a **resident python** here!

Popped into Cooroy library while Halle is at Aussie Zoo with her cousins. 

Awesome space here with a makers area (sewing machines, 3D printers), study areas, tech areas, kids areas.

I am going to try to embed a photo of my study set up...its being very tropical and rainy here with this beautiful outside area next to me:

```![Cooroy Library Exterior](/assets/images/cooroy_lib.jpg)```  
this is how I would insert the photo in markdown, but I think the .jpg will be too big. Trying html. 

<img src="https://walkertetrisranger.github.io/my-blog/assets/images/cooroy_lib.jpg" width="600" style="border-radius: 8px;">

Adding a photo turned into my first ~~30 mins~~...nope make that hour and 15 lol. Learnt about github image size limits, and fixing syntax errors. 

First I had to create a directory on my github repository. 

```
mkdr -p assets/images
```

Then I had to put in a .gitkeep file as a placeholder  
navigate to the directory ```cd assets/images```  
then create the .gitkeep ``` touch .gitkeep```  
had to navigate back to main and then push changes to githup...

Makes me feel some sorta way with lines of code open in the library drinking an energy drink. 


Diving into more python now I swear.
